Over the period of applying to PhDs and being in a PhD, I've read quite a few articles that give advice or insights on life as a PhD student/early career scientist, and advice on being in science and academia generally. Here are my favourites:

* ["Advice for a (Young) Investigator"](http://ce.sysu.edu.cn/hope/UploadFiles/Education/2012/8/201208212105373432.pdf)

* [Advice from the ever-insightful Jean Yang (@jeanqasaur)](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/academic%20advice)

* ["The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tenure-Track Faculty Life"](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/)

* ["You and Your Research" by Richard Hamming](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)

* ["How to Have a Bad Career in Research/Academia Pre-PhD and Post-PhD"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzis5MXW83vCdUdXYnFIVDVOSkE/view)

* ["Tough love: An insensitive guide to thriving in your PhD"](http://neurochambers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html)

* ["The importance of stupidity in scientific research"](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771.full)

Note: possibly the best piece of advice I've come across is that you shouldn't pay attention to other people's advice. Advice is not 'one size fits all'. People may attribute their successes to unrelated factors; correlation is not causation, etc.
