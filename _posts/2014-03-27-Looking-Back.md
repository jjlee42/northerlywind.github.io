title: Looking back at&#58; Academic goals for 2014
---

It's been another busy term! Perhaps not so many new starts but a lot of marathoning to keep going. I wanted to review my goals for 2014 first, and look at which goals I have met. 

#### Science writing
This worked out well! Not only did I both write an article in the university science magazine's blog and the Bulletin (about the use of Twitter), I also wrote more. I wrote a short news article for The Psychologist, which is exciting. Finally, I submitted a paper to some small student organisations. 

#### Public engagement
This went well too! As I wanted, I participated in Brain Awareness Week - unfortunately, it was only for a day but it was still fun. Today I participated in another STEM activity, so I did manage two in a year. Yesterday, I helped with the visit day which was great fun, and I'll be doing the other two visit days as well. Hopefully, I will remember to sign up for open days when I know where in the world I'll be in late June. Pint of Science hasn't happened yet but fingers crossed. In terms of other activities, I went to a meeting of the Bristol and Bath Branch which was very interesting. I've been looking into getting some events set up for the next year, too. 

#### Academic social networking
This blog didn't receive any more posts but I think I was fairly active on Twitter. It remains to be a very useful resource (and a short time-killer!). 

#### Technical skills
I'm not sure how much of this I have achieved so far. I have been using R more, so I supposed I've been more experienced in it. I also went to the 'Rails Girls' event in Bristol where I learned a bit of Ruby and tried Ruby on Rails. As for Python and MATLAB, I haven't touched those two since the last blog post - maybe I'll get a chance in the summer. Speaking of the summer, I think I certainly will be learning new skills! Exciting.

#### Attendâ€¦ 
Unfortunately I haven't managed to attend any Psychology in the Pub events. I have been to a few interesting departmental seminars, but only in the psychology department. Although I had a chance to go to the South West Undergraduate Conference, I chose to go to Rails Girls instead. However, I will be attending the BPS Annual Conference, for which I received a bursary, hooray! Thanks, South West Branch. I doubt I'll have a chance to attend any summer schools, but I think the Amgen programme will teach me many skills anyway. 

#### Reading
I haven't finished either of the two books yet! I may have read a page or two more of Thinking Fast and Slow - but none of the computational modelling book. However, I recently looked at the R code for it, which is something, at least!
