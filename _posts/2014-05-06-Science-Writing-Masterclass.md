title: Science Writing Masterclass
---

Just over a week ago, I attended a [guardian masterclass on science blogging](www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/science-blogging-james-randerson-blogging-course). Although the class didn’t have a practical component where we actually sat down and wrote, it was quite insightful in that it featured four talks by people in the science writing ‘business’. Some of the tips were fairly obvious, such as the importance of finding a niche for your blog to stand out and outlining your goals before you start up. However, other tips were new to me, so in that sense it was worth it. For instance, if you are writing publicly, you have to be careful of who could see your blog, and the implicit assumption that you are connected with your department/institution. In any case, it was an interesting use of time and certainly made me more inspired to do some science writing!
