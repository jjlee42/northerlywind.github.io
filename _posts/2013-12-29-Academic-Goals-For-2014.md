title: Academic goals for 2014
---

I stated some of these on Twitter ([@synapticlee](https://twitter.com/synapticlee)) but I thought I would elaborate here.

#### Science writing

Firstly, I hope to do some more science writing this year, either in the university science magazine or the Bulletin again. I’ve been thinking of an article on public engagement (see below) or Twitter. Hopefully at some point I can get into the actual journal, but I don’t know if that will happen. If articles are running low, I will write for Psyche as well.

#### Public engagement

I hope to participate in Brain Awareness Week (Brilliant Brains Week in At-Bristol) again. This year I’m not sure how free I will be around that time, but I’ll aim for it, anyway. In addition, I want to get involved in more STEM activities. I don’t know how many relevant opportunities will be available, but it would be nice to have two in a year. In addition, I want to help with the visit days and open days again. I really enjoy engaging with potential students on TSR and in the past visit/open days, so it would be fun to do it again! Finally – this is not so much a goal as a wish – I hope Pint of Science goes well! Short term goals on this front include finding/finalising speakers and finding the pub(s), equipment, etc. It’s going to be a good event!

#### Academic social networking

I would like to have more posts on this blog and increase my presence on Twitter! Hopefully one of the two will happen. Twitter is turning out to be a very useful resource for increasing my knowledge on current affairs/research.

#### Technical skills

I hope to gain technical skills from (potential) research projects in 2014, the summer in particular, such as neuroimaging, computer programs, behavioural techniques, etc. However, I also aim to learn more on my own. In particular I want to hone my skills in the programs I have started learning: R, perhaps Python, and almost definitely MATLAB. Not so much a technical skill, but I definitely want to (try to) learn calculus over the summer/Easter – no idea if I’ll have the time to do it, though!

#### Attend events/conferences/summer schools

In 2014, I’ll definitely try to attend more events, such as Psychology in the Pub by the BPS, maybe I’ll look into the science cafés at the Tobacco Factory, departmental seminars in psychology and neuroscience, and anything else interesting that comes up. More importantly, I’ll try to attend at least one conference – definitely trying to attend the South West Undergraduate Conference, which I missed last year. As well, I would like to attend the BPS Annual Conference (in Birmingham) for (at least) a day. I haven’t tried to compare the timings against my diary yet. If I’m free, I’ll try to go – it will be expensive, but I’ll look into the available bursaries and see if I could apply for them. Finally, summer schools. This depends on my holiday/summer research plans, of course. If I have the time, though, it would be excellent to attend another summer school.

#### Reading

I am going to try to finish the computational modeling book from last summer, and Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow. The latter I will probably manage, not sure about the first. However, I will definitely aim to play around with the R code for it.
