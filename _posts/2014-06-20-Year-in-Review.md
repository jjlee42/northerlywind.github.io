title: Year in Review
---

I’ve held off on writing this blog post for a while, intending to wait until I received all my marks for this year. Today I received my exam results, so now I have no excuse! So, I’d like to review this academic year and evaluate what I’ve done in relation to my ‘academic goals’. 

Second year. The middle year. Wow. Everyone says this, but it really feels like everything has gone by so fast. In fact, I barely feel like I’ve started uni - yet here I am, nearly a finalist. I think overall it has been a very successful year - I have done a lot more, learned a lot more (I’d hope!) and worked a lot harder. In general, I am surer of what I want to do and how to do it than I was a year ago. In fact, I can’t believe how naïve I was at times last year! 

Academics alone, I think I’ve done quite well - objectively, better than first year. Not sure what else there is to say on the matter, but I’m mostly happy with how things have turned out. My proudest coursework-achievement was getting an incredibly high mark on the last laboratory report of my degree, but I’m also pleased with my overall average. Marks aside, I have enjoyed presenting the seminars this year and look forward to individual seminars next year. 

In any case, in review of my academic goals - I have done some science writing, mostly reviews of events. I intend to do more, as is always the case. However, the science blogging masterclass I attended at The Guardian helped motivate me - a bit. 

Pint of Science did indeed go well - it was well-received, despite some hiccups in the beginning. In terms of public engagement, I have done ten-fold more than I had last year. Since then, I have volunteered for countless events, gone to several school trips, and become a member of the British Science Association, as well as (recently) ambassador for the national co-ordinating centre for public engagement. Truly, I have become much more involved in this work, and much of it is thanks to the opportunities discovered through Twitter. 

As for social networking, Twitter has helped - and I’ve also met some interesting people through science events. However, very few of these people I have stayed in contacted with - perhaps something to consider for next year. 

Next, technical skills - this goal is always something on the back burner. This summer, I have engaged a bit with MATLAB as a result of my third year project. As well, I have, only this summer, started on my calculus book. Although I have done hardly any problem solving, I am in the midst of learning theory. On another note, I made my newest CV in LaTeX (actually XeTex) so that’s an achievement! This summer I will also learn lab-based skills during my summer research placement, which has also been supported by the British Association of Psychopharmacology. 

Events! I attended many events, including my first conference, which you can read about on this blog. Although I haven’t attended any science cafés, I suppose given my role with the BSA I really should in the near future! Unfortunately, I didn’t have any spare time for summer schools this summer - however, my summer scholarship includes professional development, so I’ll take that. Next year, I assume I’ll be busy with more research - but hopefully I’ll have time to attend at least a workshop. 

Finally, I still haven’t made progress on the two books I wanted to. However, I have been reading Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s *Advice for a Young Investigator*, and I am finding it very valuable. I hope to finish it by the end of the summer. 

Briefly, some goals for next year:

* Apply for postgraduate programs in neuroscience and cognitive science

* Send abstracts to undergraduate and national conferences

* Submit an article to a student journal 

* Do some more networking... and follow-up

* Find a way for Psyche to live on...?
