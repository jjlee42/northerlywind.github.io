title: Pint of Science 2015 
---

This is the second year I've been involved as an event manager for [Pint of Science](http://pintofscience.co.uk/events/bristol/) with the Bristol neuroscience-themed pubs. In case you haven't already heard me post all over Twitter about it, it's a three-night international science festival set in pubs. The relaxed setting makes it unique from many other public talks, and makes it easy for the public to engage with scientists. We had a great line-up this year, and you can see photos from Tuesday and Wednesday's talks on 'Maladies of the Mind' and 'Dreams and Reality' below.
