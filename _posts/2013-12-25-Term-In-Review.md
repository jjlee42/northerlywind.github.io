title: The Term In Review
---

It’s been quite a busy term, better in many ways. On the academic side of things, I’ve been succeeding in doing work spaced out over time, rather than the week and weekend before (to a degree). I’ve also tried to keep up with lecture notes and reading as much as possible – but after a point in the first few weeks, I found it was too time consuming. As for academic extra curriculars, I’ve certainly been doing as much as, and more than, last year. I was able to go to a school as a STEM Ambassador; I hope to get another chance next year. I also managed to get more volunteer experience in public engagement, such as volunteering for the Bristol Neuroscience Festival and Pint of Science. I think the latter will be an interesting and fun challenge. In terms of publications, I’ve started to help with editing PsychTalk for the British Psychological Society, and started up Psyche, which I’m very proud of. The first issue genuinely looks really good (content-wise, I have yet to finish the layout design!) and I hope everyone really likes it. Just need to sort out that launch!

In terms of research, what a term. I’ve been involved in two projects, which has been really fun and good experience. Next term, I may help out with another project – although I’ll try to make it non-concurrent! Finally, of course, I’ve been working hard on my applications for research next summer. Unfortunately I didn’t get much time last term to think about a dissertation; it would be ideal to do it in computational neuroscience, but a) I’m not sure who has the expertise to supervise me on such a topic and b) I’m not sure if I have the background for it. If I, somehow, get such a project I will definitely try to improve my programming skills over the summer.

All in all, academically I’ve been doing fine/well – but it’s the extra curricular academic experience that has been really exciting and challenging (in a good way). Excitingly, the next term will contain the areas of psychology I am really interested in, namely psycholinguistics, neuropsychology, biological psychology. Oh, and I’ve been trying to slim down my list of postgraduate programmes… it is still huge, with 20 programs I’m interested in. Lots of changes ahead: dissertations, summer applications and (hopefully) offer(s), exams, so on and so forth. Hopefully I’ll have some exciting news to report by the end of next term!
