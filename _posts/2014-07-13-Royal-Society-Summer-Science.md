title: Royal Society Summer Science

This year, I was a volunteer in the Digital Team for the Royal Society summer science exhibition, which ran the first week of July. Along with three other volunteers, I produced videos on the exhibits for the Royal Society youtube channel. Specifically, I edited a video the others had shot - an interview of the exhibitors at the 'Leafcutter ants and their antibiotics' exhibit. The final video ended up as a short quiz on ants by Dr Phil Leftwich, seen here:

As well, another volunteer and I interviewed Dr Matt Taylor, project scientist of the Rosetta mission. I edited the subsequent footage into a summary of the project and their plans for the near future, which can be seen here:

Although I have shot and edited videos before, it was mostly for school or personal purposes. So, I found it quite rewarding to use a 'backbench' skill of mine for the Royal Society to serve as public engagement. I had never conducted a video interview before, so it was a learning experience! It's interesting to see how little of the footage makes it into the final cut, and often not in the same order. 

In general, it was a great experience to be part of the summer science exhibition. We were privileged to engage with a lot of interesting research going on, and interview some of the exhibitors up close. Sadly we couldn't make videos of all the exhibits as we only had a week to work. However, it's clear that the Royal Society puts on a very good show!
