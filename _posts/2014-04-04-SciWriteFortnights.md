title: SciWriteFortnights - Science writing once a fortnight.
---

Writing is all about forcing yourself to do something. It’s about sticking to a routine. It’s about writing even though it’s terrible, because writing something bad is better than not writing at all. My solution: ‘SciWriteFortnights’. I’d like anyone who is interested to join me!

The idea is simple: once a fortnight, try to write one article about an interesting bit of science. The minimum requirements are only one article, only one draft, only for your own purposes. You can do more, but there’s no pressure to do so! It can be really bad and really short. 

I had the idea because I haven’t really done much science writing but I’d very much like to do more. So, I thought this would develop my skills and increase my repertoire of writing samples. If any of these articles turn out well I may post them on this blog or elsewhere. But that’s not the point. The point is just to get out there and do it. 

For those reading who are University of Bristol psychology students - this is a great exercise to get some submissions written for Psyche!

The two weeks start now. Pick an article or a scientific concept and get started! I will tweet about it using #sciwritefortnights and I encourage anyone else participating to do the same.
