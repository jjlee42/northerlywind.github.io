I am in my second year as a PhD student at the [Functional Neuromics Lab](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab) at UCL. I use two-photon calcium imaging to understand decision-making at the neural and population levels.

Before joining the lab, I had a rotation year in which I worked in the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), [Neural Encoding Lab](https://bendorlab.wordpress.com/) and [Macaskill Lab](http://macaskilllab.com/).

I have a BSc in Psychology at the University of Bristol, my first year of which was in the joint honours BSc in Psychology and Philosophy. In the past I worked on cognitive computational models of reading, behavioral measures of compulsivity, and structural MRI biomarkers of dementia, as well as small projects in psycholinguistics and perceptual decision-making. 

Before I was aware of a career as an academic scientist, I was set on being a journalist, graphic designer or author.
