First year Wellcome Trust PhD student in Neuroscience at UCL. Interested in neurocomputational models of reinforcement learning and perceptual decision-making. I spent my first rotation at [the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), my second rotation at the [Neural Encoding Lab](https://bendorlab.wordpress.com/) (in the Institute for Behavioural Neuroscience), and I'm spending my third in the [Macaskill Lab](http://macaskilllab.com/).

In the past I have worked on cognitive models of reading, behavioural measures of compulsivity, and structural MRI biomarkers of dementia.
