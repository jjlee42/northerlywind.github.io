Second year Wellcome Trust PhD student in Neuroscience at UCL. 

Doing my PhD in the [Cortical Processing Lab](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cortexlab). 

Interested in neurocomputational models of reinforcement learning and perceptual decision-making. I spent my first rotation at [the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/), my second rotation at the [Neural Encoding Lab](https://bendorlab.wordpress.com/) (in the Institute for Behavioural Neuroscience), and my third rotation in the [Macaskill Lab](http://macaskilllab.com/).

Previously I did a BSc in Psychology at the University of Bristol. In the past I have worked on cognitive computational models of reading, behavioural measures of compulsivity, and structural MRI biomarkers of dementia.
